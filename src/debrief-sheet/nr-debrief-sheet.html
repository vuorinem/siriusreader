          The purpose of the current study is to observe undergraduate psychology students’ reading strategies during
          electronic academic reading. Sirius Reader was developed specifically for this project and it allows the
          objective observation of the frequency of page turns, devices used for reading, timing and duration of reading
          sessions, and usage of annotation features. Questionnaires were used to assess your academic motivation,
          reading preferences and strategies.

          Previous research has indicated that university students tend to prefer reading academic materials in print
          form (Baron, Calixte, &amp; Havewala, 2017; Mizrahi et al., 2016). Nevertheless, the majority of academic
          reading is done electronically (Ji, Michaels, &amp; Waterman, 2014). Questionnaire studies have indicated that
          students’ do not rely on the same strategies when reading electronically as when reading printed material
          (Mizrachi et al., 2016) but we currently have limited knowledge on which strategies students employ during
          digital academic reading. The objective of this study is to enhance our understanding of electronic strategy
          usage in students’ everyday life. The results can be applied to inform future interventions directed at
          enhancing electronic strategy usage in university.
