          <h1>On Being Sane in Insane Places</h1>

          <h2>D.L. Rosenhan (1973)</h2>

          <p>
            If sanity and insanity exist, how shall we know them? The question is neither capricious nor itself insane.
            However much we may be personally convinced that we can tell the normal from the abnormal, the evidence is
            simply not compelling. It is commonplace, for example, to read about murder trials wherein eminent
            psychiatrists for the defense are contradicted by equally eminent psychiatrists for the prosecution on the
            matter of the defendant's sanity. More generally, there are a great deal of conflicting data on the
            reliability, utility, and meaning of such terms as "sanity," "insanity," "mental illness," and
            "schizophrenia". Finally, as early as 1934, Benedict suggested that normality and abnormality are not
            universal. What is viewed as normal in one culture may be seen as quite aberrant in another. Thus, notions
            of normality and abnormality may not be quite-as accurate as people believe they are.
          </p>

          <p>
            To raise questions regarding normality and abnormality is in no way to question the fact that some behaviors
            are deviant or odd. Murder is deviant. So, too, are hallucinations. Nor does raising such questions deny the
            existence of the personal anguish that is often associated with "mental illness." Anxiety and depression
            exist. Psychological suffering exists. But normality and abnormality, sanity and insanity, and the diagnoses
            that flow from them may be less substantive than many believe them to be.
          </p>

          <p>
            At its heart, the question of whether the sane can be distinguished from the insane (and whether degrees of
            insanity can be distinguished from each other) is a simple matter: do the salient characteristics that lead
            to diagnoses reside in the patients themselves or in the environments and contexts in which observers find
            them?

          <h2>D.L. Rosenhan (1973)</h2>

          <p>
            From Bleuler, through Kretchmer, through the formulators of the recently revised Diagnostic and Statistical
            Manual of the American Psychiatric Association, the belief has been strong that patients present symptoms,
            that those symptoms can be categorized, and, implicitly, that the sane are distinguishable from the insane.
            More recently, however, this belief has been questioned. Based in part on theoretical and anthropological
            considerations, but also on philosophical, legal, and therapeutic ones, the view has grown that
            psychological categorization of mental illness is useless at best and downright harmful, misleading, and
            pejorative at worst. Psychiatric diagnoses, in this view, are in the minds of the observers and are not
            valid summaries of characteristics displayed by the observed.
          </p>

          <p>
            Gains can be made in deciding which of these is more nearly accurate by getting normal people (that is,
            people who do not have, and have never suffered, symptoms of serious psychiatric disorders) admitted to
            psychiatric hospitals and then determining whether they were discovered to be sane and, if so, how. If the
            sanity of such pseudopatients were always detected, there would be prima facie evidence that a sane
            individual can be distinguished from the insane context in which he is found. Normality (and presumably
            abnormality) is distinct enough that it can be recognized wherever it occurs, for it is carried within the
            person. If, on the other hand, the sanity of the pseudopatients were never discovered, serious difficulties
            would arise for those who support traditional modes of psychiatric diagnosis. Given that the hospital staff
            was not incompetent, that the pseudopatient had been behaving as sanely as he had been outside of the
            hospital, and that it had never been previously suggested that he belonged in a psychiatric hospital, such
            an unlikely outcome would support the view that psychiatric diagnosis betrays little about the patient but
            much about the environment in which an observer finds him.

          <p>
            This article describes such an experiment. Eight sane people gained secret admission to 12 different
            hospitals. Their diagnostic experiences constitute the data of the first part of this article; the remainder
            is devoted to a description of their experiences in psychiatric institutions. Too few psychiatrists and
            psychologists, even those who have worked in such hospitals, know what the experience is like. They rarely
            talk about it with former patients, perhaps because they distrust information coming from the previously
            insane. Those who have worked in psychiatric hospitals are likely to have adapted so thoroughly to the
            settings that they are insensitive to the impact of that experience. And while there have been occasional
            reports of researchers who submitted themselves to psychiatric hospitalization, these researchers have
            commonly remained in the hospitals for short periods of time, often with the knowledge of the hospital
            staff. It is difficult to know the extent to which they were treated like patients or like research
            colleagues. Nevertheless, their reports about the inside of the psychiatric hospital have been valuable.
            This article extends those efforts.

            The eight pseudopatients were a varied group. One was a psychology graduate student in his 20's. The
            remaining seven were older and "established." Among them were three psychologists, a pediatrician, a
            psychiatrist, a painter, and a housewife. Three pseudopatients were women, five were men. All of them
            employed pseudonyms, lest their alleged diagnoses embarrass them later. Those who were in mental health
            professions alleged another occupation in order to avoid the special attentions that might be accorded by
            staff, as a matter of courtesy or caution, to ailing colleagues.
