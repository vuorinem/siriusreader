    In this study you will be asked to complete three questionnaires on separate occasions and read a
    course-relevant academic article. You can withdraw from the study at any point without any loss of course
    credit by selecting ‘withdraw’ from the right-hand corner menu.

    First you will be asked to complete a consent form and then two questionnaires on your academic reading
    habits and motivation towards your course. Then, you will complete a reading speed test by reading a short
    text at your normal reading speed. You will then be able to select a course you are currently on to access
    the academic article that is recommended reading for the course. You have 7 days to read the article from now
    onwards and you will be sent automatic reminder emails by the E-reader Website of the time remaining. You can
    read the article at your convenience on any mobile device, laptop or computer by entering
    <mark>ereader.website</mark> in the browser bar.
  </p>

  <p class="text-justify">
    After the 7 days, you will be sent a link to the final questionnaire and you will receive a debrief sheet
    soon after. SONA credits will be awarded to you after the final questionnaire.
  </p>

  <p class="text-justify">
    This information sheet will be accessible from the right-hand corner menu of the E-reader Website at any time
    during the study.
